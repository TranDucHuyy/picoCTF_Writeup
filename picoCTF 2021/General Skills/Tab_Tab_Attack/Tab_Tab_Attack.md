# Description

Using tabcomplete in the Terminal will add years to your life, esp. when dealing with long rambling directory structures and filenames: [Addadshashanammu.zip](https://mercury.picoctf.net/static/fe16c756149cfa85f23e73cd9dbd6a25/Addadshashanammu.zip)

# Hints

- After `unzip`ing, this problem can be solved with 11 button-presses...(mostly Tab)...

# Solution

- We need unzip file by `unzip` and use tab to move to the final file
- This is `ELF` file so we can use `./fang-of-haynekhtnamet` to run this file
