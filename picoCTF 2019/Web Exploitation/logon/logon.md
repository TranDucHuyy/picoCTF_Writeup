# Description

The factory is hiding things from all of its users. Can you login as Joe and find what they've been looking at? `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/13594/)) or `http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:13594`

# Hints

Hmm it doesn't seem to check anyone's password, except for Joe's?

# Solution

We are dealing with a more complex portal that doesn’t store any sensitive information on the client side. However, it’s still possible to bypass it by altering the cookies. By inspecting the page elements and navigating to the Application tab, we can see that three cookies are stored upon login: a username as a string, a password as a string, and an admin status as a boolean. Changing the value of the admin cookie from "False" to "True" tricks the server into recognizing us as an admin, allowing access to the site.
