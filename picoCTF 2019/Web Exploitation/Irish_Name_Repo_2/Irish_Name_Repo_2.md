# Description

There is a website running at `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/64649/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/64649/)). Someone has bypassed the login before, and now it's being strengthened. Try to see if you can still login! or `http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:64649`

# Hints

The password is being filtered.

# Solution

- In this article, Sql error was prevented when using `' OR 1==1--`. Let's think about another attack that only uses usernames (because password is being filtered).

- Let's try `admin'--`
``` java
 SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='$username' AND password='$password';
 ```
 When we put in our injection, the query becomes:
``` java
SELECT username, password FROM users WHERE username='admin'--' AND password='';
```
