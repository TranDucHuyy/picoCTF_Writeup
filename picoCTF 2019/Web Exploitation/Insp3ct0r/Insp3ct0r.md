Kishor Balan tipped us off that the following code may need inspection: `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/` ([link](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/41511/)) or `http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:41511`

# Hints

- How do you inspect web code on a browser?
- There's 3 parts

# Solution

- when testing web code on browser, we will test 3 parts: HTML, CSS, JS

- Let's start with HTML in the `Inspector` section, try use `ctrl + f` to find flag, we will have part 1: `picoCTF{tru3_d3`
