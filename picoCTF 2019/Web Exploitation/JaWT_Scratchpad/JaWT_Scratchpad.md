# Description

Check the admin scratchpad! `https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/problem/63090/` or `http://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org:63090`

# Hints

- What is that cookie?
- Have you heard of JWT?

# Solution

- First, visit the given website and log in using any username except "admin". Once logged in, we'll find a JWT (JSON Web Token) in the Application tab of Chrome Developer Tools under cookies. Copy this JWT and decode it using a tool like [jwt.io](https://jwt.io/). The decoded JWT will show the algorithm (HS256) and the payload containing your username. The goal is to modify the payload to change the username to "admin", but we will need a valid signature to bypass the system.

- To find the secret key used for the signature, use JohnTheRipper and a wordlist like rockyou.txt to brute-force the secret. Run the following command: `john --wordlist=/usr/share/wordlists/rockyou.txt jwt.txt --format=HMAC-SHA256`

- Once JohnTheRipper finds the secret key, go back to jwt.io, modify the payload to change the username to "admin", and input the secret key to generate a new JWT. Finally, replace the old JWT cookie in Chrome Developer Tools with the new one, refresh the page, and you'll be logged in as admin, allowing you to access the admin scratchpad and obtain the flag.
