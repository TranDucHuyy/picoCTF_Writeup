# Description

Let's decrypt this: [ciphertext](https://jupiter.challenges.picoctf.org/static/d21037ad23ed84cfff20a84768a0f2b2/ciphertext)? Something seems a bit small.

# Hints

- RSA [tutorial](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSA_(cryptosystem))
- How could having too small an e affect the security of this 2048 bit key?
- Make sure you don't lose precision, the numbers are pretty big (besides the e value)
